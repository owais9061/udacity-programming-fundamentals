        <b>How the webpage works?</b>

        <p>THis is a bunch of computers that communicate
        with each other. When person goes to web
        page like www.google.com, their computer sends
        a <em>HTT Request</em> to a <em>Server</em>. The Server
        finds the appropriate HTML Document  and sends it back to the user's computer where <em>Web Browser</em> 
        interprets the page and display it own the userr's screen
        <a href="www.google.com"></a>
        Does a good job of explaining this term.

        <b>HTML</b>
        <p>HTMLL stands for <em>Hyper text Markup Language.</em>  HTML DOCUMENTS form the majority of the content of the web. HTML docuemnts contain <em>text content</em> which describes "What You see" 
        and writing HTML, we will tell the browser which type of each element by using HTML <b>Tags</b>
        <a href="#">This video here will explain the distinction well</a>
