# Define a function, square, that takes one number 
# as its input, and returns the square of that 
# number (result of multiplying
# the number by itself).
# To help you out, the code for sum(a,b) is below.

#def sum(a,b):
    #c= a+ b
    #return c
    
def square(a,b):
    c = a*a , b*b
    return c

print(square(10,11));
