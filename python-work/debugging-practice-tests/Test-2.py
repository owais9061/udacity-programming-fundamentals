# What do you think the programmer who wrote the following code WANTED it to do?
# ANS: The programmer wanted to print a series of numbers from 1 to 10.

# Do you think this code will work? Why or why not?
#According to Python 2, this is right (Till some extent) but according to the Python3 (Which is much more
# Syntax oriented) is is wrong, becuase of the no use of parenthesis.

#Given Code
#print 1
#print  2
#print   3
#print     4
#print        5
#print              6
#print                       7
#print                                     8
#print                                                          9
