# What do you think the programmer who wrote the following code WANTED it to do?
# ANS: The programmer wanted to print a series of numbers from 1 to 10.

# Do you think this code will work? Why or why not?
#According to Python 2, this is right (Till some extent) but according to the Python3 (Which is much more
# Syntax oriented) is is wrong, becuase of the no use of parenthesis & also the Capital P, in the
#code breaks the syntax of the code so, solving it will run the code.

#Given Code
    #print 1
    #print 2
    #print 3
    #print 4
    #print 5
    #Print 6
    #print 7
    #print 8
    #print 9

# Once you have a guess, press the "Test Run" button below.

# Tip: Read the LAST line of the error message first.

#Solved Code
